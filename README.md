# 30-1-custom-requests

Implement a program to make various types of HTTP requests to the httpbin.org service.
The user interacts with the program using the commands: “get”, “post”, “put”, “delete”, “patch”.
Depending on the command, a request of one type or another is made to the httpbin.org server.
The contents of the server response are printed to standard output.
The program terminates when the user enters the “exit” command.
